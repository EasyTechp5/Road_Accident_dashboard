## Introduction
### An overview of the Road Accident Dashboard [2020-2021]. The primary objective is to identify fatal casualties by vehicle type and analyze trends in casualties over the current and previous year. This analysis aims to provide valuable insights to inform safety decisions and strategies for road accident prevention and mitigation.
**_Disclaimer: All dataset and report do not represent any institution or organization but just a dummy dataset to demonstrate the capabilities of Microsoft Excel_**
